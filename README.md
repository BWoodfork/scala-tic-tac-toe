###Scala Tic-Tac-Toe
This is my unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Scala. The game provides the option to play human vs human or human vs computer. The computer's moves are based off of the MiniMax algorithm. Meaning it will either win the game or force a tie. Based on the state of the board.

###Dependencies
`brew install sbt`

`brew install scala`

`java 8`
(Java 8 is recommended, but the game should run on Java 7 as well.)

###Boot Up The SBT build tool
In the project's directory, boot up SBT from console with the command `sbt`

###Run Tic-Tac-Toe Game
While SBT is running, enter `Run 1` or `Run 2`
Your number choice depicts the number of players you want to play the game.
`Run 1` will allow you to play against the unbeatable AI.
`Run 2` will allow you to play against a fellow human.

###Run Unit Tests
Once SBT has booted up, run the command `test`, while in the build tool's window.
